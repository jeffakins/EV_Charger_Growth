    "## Exploring the State of the Electric Vehicle Charging Network within the U.S.\n",
    "The world's methods of transportation are evolving, not only here in the United States, but globally. The EU recently proposed a mandate that all new vehicles be emissions free after 2035. In the U.S., the Biden administrations wants half of all new vehicles to be purely electric by 2030. Regardless of the mandates, buyers may be choosing to purchase EVs over their traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) counterparts in the upcoming years. No longer do you have to choose between the environment or the car that you want to drive. Many new EVs are surpassing comparable ICE vehicles in both speed, handling, and overall capability and new models of EVs are being introduced on a regular basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, with all these new EV coming online, is the charging infrastructure keeping up? Buyers may be asking themselves, how many charging stations will be nearby if I need one? If I decide to go on a road trip, how difficult will it be to find an open charging station? I will try and answer these questions using a bit of machine learning to show the state of the charging networks now and the predicted growth over the next several years.\n",

    "So, let's begin..."

    "##### Data Cleaning:\n",
    "The following steps were taken to clean the data:\n",
    "- Dropped all rows that were not \"electric\" charging stations\n",
    "- Dropped all columns with over 1000 null values\n",
    "- Dropped an additional 12 columns that would not be used for this project\n",
    "- Changed the pricing column to only include 'free' or 'cost' in the rows\n",
    "- Filled the EV connector types nulls with the most common connector type of 'J1772'\n",
    "- Fill EV Network nulls with most common 'non network' label\n",
    "- Added values for 2 missing longitude values based on city location\n",
    "- Renamed columns for ease of referencing and use with pandas\n",
    "- Converted date columns to pandas datetime type\n",
    "- Added a column for year that the charging station was opened\n",
    "- Converted all 'count' columns into 'int' type and filled nulls with 0\n",
    "- Replaced 'Public w/descriptor' with just 'Public' in group_access_code column\n",
    "- Replaced 'Private w/descriptor' with just 'Private' in group_access_code column\n",
    "- Dropped stations (rows) that are labeled as 'planned' and not yet accessible\n",
